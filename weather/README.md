### Welcome to the Weather Project
The weather project is a collection of Python programs that introduce some basic Python using the SenseHat emulator to create a remote weather station. These programs were written to be used in a STEM program for high school students.

### Python Programs
1. `weather_lab01.py` - First Python program, variables, printing to the screen
1. `weather_lab02.py` - The SenseHat emulator, printing temperatur, pressure and humidity to the screen
1. `weather_lab03.py` - While loops, using sleep(x)
1. `weather_lab04.py` - If-then statements
1. `weather_lab05.py` - Graphing data with matplotlib
1. `weather_lab06.py` - The Internet of Things, sending data over the Internet
